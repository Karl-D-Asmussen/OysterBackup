I, Karl D. Asmussen, take no credit for any characters or settings
portrayed in, but not limited to: the show proper, the comic books,
the short film, and the promotional materials.

This text itself, the non-canon plots explored within, and any non-canon characters,
is the only thing I take credit for.
