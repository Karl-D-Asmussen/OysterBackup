"So, what *do* we do?" Steven asks.

Priyanka consults her wrist watch. "If anything, either we need to
come up with it quickly, or you two will have to text-message me if
you need anything."

"We could try to sneak in?" Steven suggests.

"How?" Connie asks.

"Through the air-ducts," he says.

Connie crosses her arms, raises an eyebrow and smirks. "*Really?* Because I
though my mother had watched too many spy thrillers..."

"Don't," Priyanka says. "It's quite dangerous --- I've heard of at least a few dozen
cases of people attempting something like that and getting horribly injured."

Connie snaps her fingers. "We'll get Clonnie to do it! I mean--- either it works or
it doesn't, right? With Clonnie, it doesn't matter if it's dangerous."

"The hospital's ventilation ducts might be too small, so you should probably have a
backup plan," Priyanka says. "... Or three. I'll leave you to it."

Alone in the parking lot, under the veil of twilight might have been romantic, were it not
for the problem at hand.

"Like, the last resort could just be a smash-and-grab," Connie suggests. "We'll put on balaklavas,
get Lion to teleport into the quarantine rooms, poof, bubble, and teleport out?"

"That'll attract a lot of attention," Steven says,

----

"How about we fuse, make a fake name-tag, put on a lab-coat and get in that way?" Steven suggests.

Connie gives a non-commital grunt. "Making a fake nametag would be hard. Besides, we would probably
have more luck with distracting the guards and then have a few Clonnies sneak in and do the deed."

"Do you think Clonnies can fight Gem Mutants?" Steven asks.

"They can if we give them real circlets."

"Point."

----

"AÌ€propos distractions, I bet we could really freak out whatever guards they have if I duplicated
them and made a clone right next to them," Connie says and giggles.

Steven looks at Connie in horror.

"Too morbid?"

Steven nods.

----

"OK, so, we *could* go raid Amethyst's costume stash and find a suit for Stevonnie, and then make
a fake badge," Connie says.

"Yeah, same problem as the fake name-tag, though."

"Yeah."

----

"Hundreds of clonnies. Storm the place," Connie says.

"Nah... Or--- maybe? Let's put it on the pile."

----

"We could wait for the Gems to come back?" Steven suggests.

"Thats... Actually not a bad plan," Connie says. "We are in over our heads on this one."

She pulls out her phone and texts Priyanka.

When additional ideas fail to present themselves, Connie and Steven
finally give up.

"So, if we're just going to wait around anyway, how about we
actually go take a look?" Connie suggests.

Steven cocks his head. "We can do that?"

"Sure, hospitals are open to the public. Well, maybe we can't actually
go see those things," Connie explains. "They'll probably be in a private
wing."

"Actually, I've never been to a real hospital. Wanna give me a tour?"

Connie's eyes light up.

Hospitals --- no matter how many medical TV shows one consumes --- are awe-inspiring
in subtle ways. Huge buildings, pervaded by a certain atmosphere.

The smell of disinfectants. The quiet. The solemnity. Especially at night.

It is evening, and the lights are turned down.

"It's dark," Steven remarks.

"That's for the benefit of the patients," Connie explains.

They walk past the empty reception desk. Behind
